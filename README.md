=========================================================

Program that calculates either the Automated Readability Index score, Flesch–Kincaid readability test score, Simple Measure of Gobbledygook score, Coleman–Liau index score, or all scores at once. Each calculation is based off of either the number of words, characters, sentences, syllables, and polysyllables.
